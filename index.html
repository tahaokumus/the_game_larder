							<p>Privacy Statement</p>
							<p>
								This privacy statement details information protections and your
								rights to control your own personal data.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the privacy notice of The Game Larder Ltd. In this
								document, "we", "our", or "us" refer to The Game Larder Ltd.
							</p>
							<p>
								INTRODUCTION<br />This privacy notice aims to inform you about
								how we collect and process any information that we collect from
								you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could
								identify you ("personal information") and information that could
								not. In the context of the law and this notice, "process" means
								collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.
								It tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects
								you.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are committed to protecting your privacy and the
								confidentiality of your personal information. Our policy is not
								just an exercise in complying with the law, but a continuation
								of our respect for you and your personal information.
							</p>
							<p>
								We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information
								you provide to us and hope that you reciprocate.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our policy complies with the Data Protection Act 2018 (Act)
								accordingly incorporating the EU General Data Protection
								Regulation (GDPR).
							</p>
							<p>
								The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our
								obligations to you in regard to the processing and control of
								your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read
								the information provided at http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org
							</p>
							<p>
								Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose
								to a third party, any information collected through our website.
							</p>
							<p>
								1. DATA WE PROCESS<br />We may collect, use, store and transfer
								different kinds of personal data about you. We have collated
								these into groups as follows:
							</p>
							<p>
								Your identity includes information such as first name, last
								name, title, company name and other identifiers that you may
								have provided at some time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Your contact information includes information such as billing
								address, delivery address, email address, telephone numbers and
								any other information you have given to us for the purpose of
								communication or meeting.
							</p>
							<p>
								Transaction data includes details about payments or
								communications to and from you and information about the
								products and services you have purchased from us.
							</p>
							<p>
								Technical data includes your internet protocol (IP) address,
								browser type and version, time zone setting and location,
								browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and
								platform and other technology on the devices you use to access
								this website.
							</p>
							<p>
								Marketing data includes your preferences in receiving marketing
								from us; communication preferences; responses and actions in
								relation to your use of our services.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may aggregate anonymous data such as statistical or
								demographic data for any purpose. Anonymous data is data that
								does not identify you as an individual. Aggregated data may be
								derived from your personal data but is not considered personal
								information in law because it does not reveal your identity.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, we may aggregate profile data to assess interest in
								a product or service.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your
								personal information so that it can identify you in any way, we
								treat the combined data as personal information and it will be
								used in accordance with this privacy notice.
							</p>
							<p>
								2. SPECIAL PERSONAL INFORMATION<br />Special personal
								information is data about your race or ethnicity, religious or
								philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political
								opinions, trade union membership, information about your health
								and genetic and biometric data. It also includes information
								about criminal convictions and offences.
							</p>
							<p>
								We do not collect any special personal information about you.
							</p>
							<p>
								3. IF YOU DO NOT PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE NEED<br />Where
								we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a
								contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data
								when requested, we may not be able to perform that contract. In
								that case, we may have to stop providing a service to you. If
								so, we will notify you of this at the time.
							</p>
							<p>
								4. THE BASES ON WHICH WE PROCESS INFORMATION ABOUT YOU<br />The
								law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we
								process different categories of your personal information and to
								notify you of the basis for each category.
							</p>
							<p>
								If a basis on which we process your personal information is no
								longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your
								data.
							</p>
							<p>
								If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you
								of the change and of any new basis under which we have
								determined that we can continue to process your information.
							</p>
							<p>
								5. INFORMATION WE PROCESS BECAUSE WE HAVE A CONTRACTUAL
								OBLIGATION WITH YOU<br />When you create an account on our
								website, buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to
								our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and
								us.
							</p>
							<p>
								In order to carry out our obligations under that contract, we
								must process the information you give us. Some of this
								information may be personal information.
							</p>
							<p>We may use it in order to:</p>
							<p>
								verify your identity for security purposes<br />sell products to
								you<br />provide you with our services<br />provide you with
								suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain
								the most from using our website<br />We process this information
								on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have
								requested we use the information before we enter into a legal
								contract.
							</p>
							<p>
								We shall continue to process this information until the contract
								between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms
								of the contract.
							</p>
							<p>
								6. INFORMATION WE PROCESS WITH YOUR CONSENT<br />Through certain
								actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship
								between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to
								provide you more information about our business, including our
								products and services, you provide your consent to us to process
								information that may be personal information.
							</p>
							<p>
								Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to
								process this information.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from
								time to time pass your name and contact information to selected
								associates whom we consider may provide services or products you
								would find useful.
							</p>
							<p>
								We continue to process your information on this basis until you
								withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your
								consent no longer exists.
							</p>
							<p>
								You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us
								orders@gamelarderclaygate.co.uk. However, if you do so, you may
								not be able to use our website or our services further.
							</p>
							<p>
								7. INFORMATION WE PROCESS FOR THE PURPOSES OF LEGITIMATE
								INTERESTS<br />We may process the information on the basis there
								is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.
							</p>
							<p>
								Where we process your information on this basis, we do after
								giving careful consideration to:
							</p>
							<p>
								whether the same objective could be achieved through other
								means<br />whether processing (or not processing) might cause
								you harm<br />whether you would expect us to process your data,
								and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to
								do so<br />For example, we may process your data on this basis
								for the purposes of:
							</p>
							<p>
								record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of
								our business<br />responding to unsolicited communication from
								you to which we believe you would expect a response<br />protecting
								and asserting the legal rights of any party<br />insuring
								against or obtaining professional advice that is required to
								manage business risk<br />protecting your interests where we
								believe we have a duty to do so
							</p>
							<p>
								8. INFORMATION WE PROCESS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION<br />Sometimes,
								we must process your information in order to comply with a
								statutory obligation.
							</p>
							<p>
								For example, we may be required to give information to legal
								authorities if they so request or if they have the proper
								authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.
							</p>
							<p>This may include your personal information.</p>
							<p>
								9. COMPLAINTS REGARDING CONTENT ON OUR WEBSITE<br />If you
								complain about any of the content on our website, we shall
								investigate your complaint.
							</p>
							<p>
								If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us
								to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate.
							</p>
							<p>
								Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a
								judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of
								the person who posted the content that offends you.
							</p>
							<p>
								If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we
								shall not correspond with you about it.
							</p>
							<p>
								10. INFORMATION RELATING TO YOUR METHOD OF PAYMENT<br />The
								preferred payment option is via BACS bank transfer initiated by
								yourself. Monthly payments for rental should be set up as a
								standing order, again, initiated by yourself. Payment
								information is therefore never taken by us or transferred to us
								either through our website or otherwise. None of your bank
								details, for instance, are stored on our systems.
							</p>
							<p>
								11. COMMUNICATING WITH US<br />When you contact us, whether by
								telephone, through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data
								you have given to us in order to reply with the information you
								need.
							</p>
							<p>
								We record your request and our reply in order to increase the
								efficiency of our business.

								messages, such as your name and email address so as to be able
								to track our communications with you to provide a high-quality
								service.

							<p>
								12. COMPLAINING<br />When we receive a complaint, we record all
								the information you have given to us.
							</p>
							<p>We use that information to resolve your complaint.</p>
							<p>
								If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other
								person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the
								information contained in your complaint. We do this as
								infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole
								discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do,
								what that information is.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from
								this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not
								in a way that could identify you or any other person.
							</p>

								these parties obtain. Accordingly, this privacy notice does not
								cover the information practices of these third parties.
